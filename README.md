This micro-lib allows you to provide a script which sets an environment using unix style and have it work on windows too

## Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 4.0 or greater.

## Usage

I use this in my npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config build/webpack.config.js"
  }
}
```

Ultimately, the command that is executed (using `spawn`) is:

```
webpack --config build/webpack.config.js
```

The `NODE_ENV` environment variable will be set by `cross-env`

You can also split a command into several ones, or separate the environment variables declaration from the actual command execution. You can do it this way:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "parentScript": "cross-env GREET='Joe' npm run childScript",
    "childScript": "echo Hello $GREET"
    }
}
```

Where `childScript` holds the actual command to execute and `parentScript` sets the environment variables to use.
Then instead of run the childScript you run the parent. This is quite useful for launching the same command with different env variables or when the environment variables are too long to have everything in one line.

If you need to translate environment variables before setting them, use [`cross-var`](https://github.com/elijahmanor/cross-var).  Example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "parentScript": "cross-var cross-env NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:./app/scripts foo"
    }
}
```

## Why?

Most Windows command prompts will choke when you set environment variables with `NODE_ENV=production` like that. (The exception is [Bash on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about), which uses native Bash.)

`cross-env` makes it so you can have a single command without worrying about setting the environment
variable properly for the platform. Just set it like you would if it's running on a unix system, and
`cross-env` will take care of setting it properly.

## Known limitations

If you plan to do something like this:

```
cross-env FOO=bar && echo $FOO
```

And expect it to output `bar` you're going to be sad, for two reasons:

1. Technically, those will run as two separate commands, so even though `FOO` will properly be set to `bar` in the first command, the `echo $FOO` will not.
2. When `echo $FOO` runs, the `$FOO` variable is replaced with the variable value, before it's even passed to `cross-env` (though, as indicated in #1, that doesn't happen anyway)

The main use case for this package is to simply run another script which will (itself) respond to the environment
variable. These limitations are not a problem in that scenario (like in the example).

If you want to modularize your npm scripts take a look at the proposed solution on the usage section.
